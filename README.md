## Local development

## Angular

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.3.23.

## Background

Created this project to demo how fast you can create a simple game in angular. I've also added the branches to see this process
- [`cleanstart`](https://github.com/Samjayyy/mastermind/tree/cleanstart): The empty project to start from
- [`attempt1`](https://github.com/Samjayyy/mastermind/tree/attempt1): A first basic implementation, where everything is put in one component
- [`attempt2`](https://github.com/Samjayyy/mastermind/tree/attempt2): Cleaning up the first attempt to show how you can use components inside components, eventemitters, ..
- [`master`](https://github.com/Samjayyy/mastermind/): A version that is ready to use. It shows that the last 10% takes up 50% of the time.
